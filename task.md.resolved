# ClickDep v2 — Self-Hosted Deployment Platform

## Planning
- [/] Deep architecture design with Docker containerization
- [/] Design 100 unique, useful features
- [/] Write implementation plan
- [ ] Get user approval

## Execution — Backend Core
- [ ] Project scaffolding (package.json, .env, Docker configs)
- [ ] Database layer (SQLite with full schema)
- [ ] Framework detection engine (14+ frameworks)
- [ ] Docker container manager (create, start, stop, resource limits)
- [ ] Deploy pipeline (clone → detect → build image → run container)
- [ ] Nginx reverse proxy manager (dynamic config generation)
- [ ] API routes (projects, system, analytics, webhooks)
- [ ] WebSocket server (live logs, status updates, notifications)
- [ ] GitHub integration (OAuth, webhooks, branch deploy)
- [ ] Scheduling & cron system
- [ ] Backup & snapshot system

## Execution — Frontend Dashboard
- [ ] Design system (CSS tokens, dark theme, glassmorphism)
- [ ] SPA shell & router
- [ ] Dashboard view (project cards, search, filters, stats)
- [ ] Project detail view (tabs: overview, deployments, logs, settings, analytics)
- [ ] New project wizard (GitHub / URL / Upload)
- [ ] Resource management UI (CPU/RAM sliders, presets)
- [ ] System monitor (real-time CPU, memory, disk, network)
- [ ] Settings & configuration pages
- [ ] Notifications & toast system

## Verification
- [ ] Server starts and API responds
- [ ] Deploy a test project from GitHub URL
- [ ] Verify Docker container creation with resource limits
- [ ] Verify start/stop/restart state machine
- [ ] Browser walkthrough of all dashboard views
